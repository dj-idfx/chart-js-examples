# Chart.js examples

Official website:  
https://www.chartjs.org/  

For this demo project we use the [Parcel](https://parceljs.org/) build tool for compiling assets.

## Installation

    npm install  

## Development

    npm run dev

This command will compile your project to the /dist folder and start the local dev server.  
By default, it starts a server at http://localhost:1234

## Production

    npm run build

This will compile and optimize your project for production inside the /build folder.
